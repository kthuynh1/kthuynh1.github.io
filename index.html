		<h2>about me</h2>
			<p>my name is katie huynh. i was born in greenville, south carolina and i lived there for all my life up until going to university.
			i have two dogs, sparkie and fabio, and one cat, spider. i like to game, crochet, and watch youtube/netflix in my free time. lately, 
			i have not had much time to do any of that since college has been really stressful.</p>

		<h2 id="words" class="hidden">future career plans</h2>
			<p id="plans" class="hidden">my major in university is environmental science. i am not sure what i want to do since i am a freshman and i just got here. 
			i think i want to turn businesses more sustainable or even make a cheap sustainable business for myself. ever since i got to college
			though, everyone has been asking me what i want to do as if i should have my life figured out. this repeated question sends me into
			a mental loop of questioning everything in my life so that's why i don't have much to say.
